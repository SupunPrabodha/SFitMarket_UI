# SFitMarket - UI Prototype

## Overview
SFitMarket is a mobile app UI prototype designed as part of my 2nd-year, 2nd-semester project for the Mobile Application Development (MAD) module. The app targets fitness enthusiasts, providing a seamless platform to shop for supplements, fitness accessories, clothes, shoes, and more. This project focuses exclusively on the UI design and navigation flows, created using Figma—no backend or databases are implemented.

## Feedback
I’d love to hear your thoughts! Feel free to open an issue on this repository or reach out to me directly. As a student project, any feedback from the design/dev community would be incredibly valuable.

## Future Plans
This project is currently a UI prototype, but I’m open to collaboration! If you’re a developer interested in adding backend functionality (e.g., APIs, databases), let’s connect and bring SFitMarket to life.
